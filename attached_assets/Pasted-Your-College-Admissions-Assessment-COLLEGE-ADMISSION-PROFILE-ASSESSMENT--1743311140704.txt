Your College Admissions Assessment
📊 COLLEGE ADMISSION PROFILE ASSESSMENT 📊 ================================================== 💯 PROFILE GRADES 💯 ================================================== ACADEMIC PROFILE: A+ (97%) EXTRACURRICULAR INVOLVEMENT: D (63%) HONORS & AWARDS: D+ (67%) OVERALL EVALUATION: B- (80%) ================================================== 📚 ACADEMIC ASSESSMENT: A+ (97%) 📚 ================================================== Your academic record is strong with a 4 GPA and 5 AP/advanced courses. Your test scores are solid, though you need higher scores (1500+ SAT/34+ ACT) to be truly competitive for top-20 schools. Strengths: Strong GPA. Weaknesses: Test scores below target range for selective colleges. ================================================== 🏆 EXTRACURRICULAR ASSESSMENT: D (63%) 🏆 ================================================== Your extracurricular profile is underdeveloped compared to competitive applicants. Top colleges seek students who have made meaningful impacts through sustained involvement and leadership. This is a critical area to strengthen before applying to selective institutions. Strengths: Weaknesses: Lack of leadership positions. Few activities related to intended major. Limited extracurricular engagement. No activities with significant time commitment. ================================================== 🏅 HONORS & AWARDS ASSESSMENT: D+ (67%) 🏅 ================================================== This area is significantly underdeveloped. Competitive applicants to selective colleges typically have multiple recognitions across different levels. The lack of formal recognition puts you at a disadvantage against applicants with demonstrated excellence. Strengths: Weaknesses: Lack of national-level recognition. No state/regional achievements. Limited formal recognition. No awards related to intended major. ================================================== 🔍 MAJOR & CAREER FIT ASSESSMENT 🔍 ================================================== Intended Major: Computer Science Your profile shows moderate alignment with your intended major. Selective programs will want to see more concrete evidence of your interest and aptitude in this field. For Computer Science/Programming: Top programs look for coding projects, hackathon participation, math competition awards, and advanced math/CS coursework. Competition is extremely high for these majors at selective schools. ================================================== 📝 OVERALL ASSESSMENT: B- (80%) 📝 ================================================== Your profile shows strengths but has notable weaknesses that will limit competitiveness at highly selective schools (sub-15% acceptance rate). Top-30 schools would be reach options, with more realistic prospects at schools with 15-30% acceptance rates if you address key weaknesses. Focus on highlighting your strengths while addressing areas for improvement in your applications. Be strategic with your college list, including primarily target and safety schools with 1-2 reach options.
